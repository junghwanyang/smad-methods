#### Handling disagreement

- We had total 7 coders. Three pairs of coders coded 300 ~ 350 tweets (total 1000). Intercoder reliability was tested. When there was a disagreement, the third coder's opinion was counted. If three coders didn't agree, we coded it as "U"
- Three coders with high IRR scores coded 100 additional tweets.
- Total number of human coded tweets were 1300.
